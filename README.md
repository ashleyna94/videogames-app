##### Project Overview 
We explore the history of video games, analyze sales, review data, and use machine learning to predict the next "hit" videogame. We also show off some cool artwork visualizations that we have created!

From the Atari 2600 to the XBox One, we categorized video games by platform, publisher, and genre. Which platforms outshine the others? Which publishers release the most games? What genres tend to be most successful?
